1.Delhi Petrol Dealers Association (DPDA) has decided to not sell CNG today in delhi.
 
2. In a letter to Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL), the largest CNG distribution company of the country,
  DPDA president Anurag Narain wrote last month,
 “We have decided to go for no CNG sale on 10th August from 6 am to 10 pm as a mark of protest."
3.The association said that the delay in reimbursement of electricity bills to the CNG dealers of Delhi by IGL,
  had prompted them to take this stringent step.

  facilities to the dealers of Delhi who are incurring huge financial losses every month," DPDA president wrote.
